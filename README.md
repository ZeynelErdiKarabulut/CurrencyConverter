# Currency Converter App

#### An application for converting one currencies into other.

This app will list 20+ different currencies and their rates. You can select any currency adn enter the amount of that currency to convert and app will show converted amount for all 20+ currencies simultaneously. 
This app polls the server to get the latest currency rates every 1 second. If any error occurs and API call fails (due to server error or no network connection), the polling mechanism tries to recover from error automatically. 

## Architecture Highlights:
- Uses MVVM Architecture
- Uses android architecture components such as livedata and ViewModel. 
- Uses dagger2 for dependency injection. This is to provide clear separation between different architecture layers. Helps to write testable code.
- Single activity application.
- Uses retrofit as networking client.


## How to run tests?
- Make sure you connect physical device or run an emulator before running the UI tests.
- To run tests, run following command:
```bash
./gradlew cAT
```

## Acknowledgement:
- This is a sample app and it is not guaranteed that it will show latest rates for each currency. Use it as a demo purposes only.
